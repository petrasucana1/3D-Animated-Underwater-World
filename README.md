# 🐠 **3D Project: Animated Underwater World** 🌊

**Description:**
This 3D project was created in **Blender** and features the development of a detailed underwater environment, including fish, corals, jellyfish, and dolphins. I focused heavily on **rigging** and **animation** to bring realistic movement to all the elements. After rigging the objects, I applied animations to simulate natural underwater motion. A short video was recorded to showcase how everything moves and interacts in the underwater world 🐟🌊
